      <h2>What is the yearbook?</h2>
      <div class="midChunk"></div>

      <h5>A yearly collection of pictures and stories that showcase the global exploring community's creativity and insanity. It captures who was around and what we did - the parties, the daring infiltrations, the cruisy explores, and everything inbetween - rather than amazing pics 
      of people standing in tunnels (though a few of those do get in).<br><br>
      
      Please note that as much as I try to include everyone, due to submission volume and page-count I simply can't. To maximise your chances of being included, read these guidelines and ask questions if need be. Going through past Yearbooks will also 
    give you an idea of what I like.</h5>
