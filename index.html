    <h2 class="description">
      A platform for independent publishing, printing, and creative support—for passion, not profit.
      <br><br>
      Brought to life by two explorers based in England, Subliminal Press exists to help bring your work into the physical world. In a time when so much art, writing, and photography lives only on screens, we want to ensure it can be held, seen, and appreciated in real life. We don’t sell work, and we don’t take a cut—we’re just here to help make it happen.
